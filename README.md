# SSN
A shit CNC made by a retard called Space.

Space owns a shit C2 called Pluto, that uses every single fucking API Key ever.

How you may ask? Space sells a CNC called SSN, so what he does is, Log it's users API Keys, and add them to Pluto.

Funny right?, well enjoy, this is only the builds I'll upload the crack soon.

# Replacement
Replacing a CNC you used before kinda sucks ass, and well you have to now.

I'm gonna take a second of your time to advertise a funny little CNC my friend owns.

[FB](FB_1234.t.me) owns a CNC by the name of Nosviak2, This CNC has been confirmed to be Fully Safe.

It has so many more features than most CNCs on the market, and it's 20$ only.

DM him to purchase.
